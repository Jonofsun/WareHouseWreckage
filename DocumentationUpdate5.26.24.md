# Game Development / Update 5.26.24

## Features Added/Updated Since Last Update:

- Finished the Physics demo with the focus of learning blueprint in unreal
- learned how to make my own functions and member functions in blueprint opening the floodgates for the main project as im now less worried about running into a roadblock
- playing around with classes and obj programming from the context of the blueprint system

## Issues Encountered

- the udemy guide while outdated is good enough to point me in the general direction for most settings or setup. IE something may be called different but is in the same area
- clicking on functions can be a little annoying when your code block gets pretty large but this seems to be corrected by making huge user made functions and calling them into the main. Just like normal programming.

## Lessons Learned

- fully ready and excited to finish up the Kingdom demo. Work on it has started in full now
- as a personal milestone id like to return to this project and try to recreate it in c++ script
